With a Bachelor of Arts Honours in Economics and a minor in Applied Computing from Brock University, I've built a robust analytical and technical skill set. My proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and key libraries like pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow allows me to translate data into actionable insights and impactful solutions.\n",
      "In my current role as a Junior Analyst at the National Research Council Canada, I’ve developed an AI chatbot to streamline client inquiries and presented survey insights via PowerBI dashboards to senior leadership, demonstrating my ability to innovate and drive results. My experiences as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Waterloo, where I streamlined grading processes and taught statistical concepts to second and third year students, along with my role at TechPlace, where I automated and documented CRM workflows, have strengthened my skills in automation, teaching complex concepts in more easy-to-understand ways and report creation.\n",
      "My career goal is to excel in data science, where I can contribute meaningfully to tech-forward projects and drive sustainable, positive change. I'm excited about using data to build a future where technology solves real-world challenges.\n",
      "Outside of my professional pursuits, I am passionate about automotives, technology, and physics, and I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.\n",
